                <p> France is a place that almost everyone would say they would love to visit. Especially for my mom and
                    sister
                    its a dream for the both of them to go on vacation over there. Home of the baguette France is well
                    known for
                    the bread they produce and have been making for a long time since Louis XIV. Its also home to one of
                    the most

                <h2>Paris</h2>
                <p> Home of the world famous Eiffel Tower Paris is a staple visit if you go to France. Being the capital
                    of France
                    it is one of the most popular tourist destinations and a typical go to for most families, couples,
                    and more.
                    The Eiffel Tower is the go to attraction in Paris having visitors climb 1,665 steps to reach the top
                    or using the
                    elevator, personally for me I would use the elevator cause thats a lot of steps. Cheese sampling is
                    also a common
                    activity for visitors with over 1000 different types of cheese for you cheese lovers to try.
