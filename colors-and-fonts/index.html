                <h2>Japan</h2>
                <p>Japan is probably the place I want to travel to the most one day. From the culture to the colorful
                    appeal of the country
                    and its 47 prefectures which are what they consider the states of Japan. Having one of the biggest
                    landmarks, Mount Fuji
                    is located in Japan with a mountain peak of 3,776 meters. I also feel that the culture in Japan is
                    more accepting of the things
                    that I enjoy doing like video games since game cafes are everywhere. A fact about Japan is that its
                    made up of 6,852 islands.

                <h2>Tokyo</h2>
                <p>Tokyo is the first place I would personally want to visit in Japan. The vibrancy of all different
                    colors of the signs and the wide
                    variety of stuff that I like make it very appealing for me and many others. I enjoy watching a lot
                    of different anime's on my free time
                    and in Tokyo there is lots of anime merchandise that you can purchase from many of the stores there.
                    Video games are also a huge thing over
                    there lots of corporations there that work on games which is something that im studying in college
                    for to become a game designer. A fact
                    about Tokyo is that it has the most top-rated restaurants in the world.
