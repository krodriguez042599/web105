                <h2>Mexico</h2>
                <p>Mexico is the only place I have traveled to out of these 3 locations and in general out of the US.
                    Since my dad is from
                    Mexico we have been over there multiple times for different reasons from visiting my dad’s side of
                    the family to just
                    going for vacation. We usually stay at my grandparents house and do activities around the area.
                    Typically when we go
                    over there always seems to be a family party that we end up attending. Even though my parents main
                    language is spanish I
                    don’t speak it frequently at all so when we end up going over there I always have to have my parents
                    talk for me because
                    I don’t know spanish well. A fact about Mexico is that there are 31 states.

                <h2>Cancún</h2>
                <p>Cancun for me is a more enjoyable experience since there are lots of activities I enjoy doing offered
                    at the hotels we
                    stay at. I have only been there twice but both times were really enjoyable. Some of my favorite
                    activities in Cancun
                    that I have done were deep sea fishing, jet skiing, and just visiting the beach. Fishing is probably
                    my most favorite
                    activity besides playing video games so getting the opportunity to go deep sea fishing is awesome
                    cause I get the chance
                    at catching fish that normally I would never see because of the area we live in. A fact about cancun
                    is that it has over
                    1.3 billion gallons of sand along the coast.
