            <h2>Why build a PC?</h2>
            <li>Building a PC is more affordable.</li>
            <li>Being able to pick every component in your system.</li>
            <li>You get to learn what goes into a PC and how they come together to become a working system.</li>
            <li>Since you assembled it, it will be easier for the future to take apart and upgrade your parts.</li>
            <li>Its a rewarding feeling after completing the build.</li>

            <h2>My Experince</h2>
            <p>I learned how to build computers when I was 11 from my dad. Over the years I have built about 20
                comptuers for my family/friends and myself. If someone asked me how hard building computers was, to
                me I think of building computers is similar to legos. After your first build its pretty easy to figure
                out
                how to find what goes where. This is a picture of my current PC, clicking sends you to parts page of all
                the components in my current PC.
