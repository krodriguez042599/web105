                <h2>Motherboard</h2>
                <img src="mb.jpg">
                <p>The motherboard is the base for every computer. It is what holds all the parts together and then
                    placed inside the computer case.</p>

                <h2>CPU</h2>
                <img src="cpu.jpg.">
                <p>The CPU is basically the brain of the computer. The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of
                    the computer that performs calculations, actions, and runs programs.</p>

                <h2>GPU</h2>
                <img src="gpu.jpg">
                <p>The GPU is used primarily for 3D applications. It is a single-chip processor that creates lighting
                    effects and transforms
                    objects every time a 3D scene is redrawn. Especially in gaming having a high quality GPU is
                    important for maintaining high framerate for smooth gaming performance.</p>

                <h2>Memory/RAM</h2>
                <img src="ram.jpg">
                <p>RAM is essentially your device's short-term memory. It temporarily stores everything that runs on
                    your PC,
                    like all the services in Windows, your web browser, your image editing tool, or the game you're
                    playing</p>
            </div>

            <div class="parts">
                <h2>Hard Drive</h2>
                <img src="hd.jpg">
                <p>Somewhat similar to the RAM the hard drive's main function is to permanently store all personal data
                    that includes pictures, music, videos, documents, and programs.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>PSUy</h2>
                <img src="ps.jpg">
                <p>Also known as power supply, The PSU is the component that supplies power to a computer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="parts">
                <h2>Computer Case</h2>
                <img src="case.jpg">
                <p>The Computer case is the housing for all the components after they have been assembled on the
                    motherboard. Picking a good case is important because different
                    cases can have better airflow than others which is important for keeping the computer from
                    overheating. Plus some cases are not compatible with certain parts. </p>
