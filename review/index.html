    <h2>What is Apex Legends</h2>
    <p><strong>Apex Legends</strong> is a battle royale developed by Respawn. It is a 60 player battle royale that consists of
        20 teams of 3 that drop into a map to find guns, armor, and more and fight it out with one another to be
        the last team standing. It is a character based game with currently 11 different legends to select from each
        with their own passive and active ablities. It is a season based game with each season containing new content
        from new legends, guns, and map changes. Currently on season 3 and almost going onto season 4 the game has
        seen a huge change from its original release back in Feburary 4th of 2019. Apex also has a very large competitive scene
        with already having mulitple majors in the United States and other countries like Poland.

    <h2>Legends</h2>
    <p><strong>Apex Legends</strong> as stated before currently has 11 legends with another one coming next month. The legends are
    usually released every season and it is currently goin onto its 4th season next month. Each legend has its strengths and weakness
    for different situations a player may encounter in game. Legends like Wattson are great at bunkering down and holding a building to 
    play around while other legends like wraith are useful for rotation due to her portal she can place for her team to move safely to the next area.
    Each legend has a passive ability which typically are the least impactful, a tactical ability which is on a varying cooldown depending on the legend,
     and finally a ultimiate which requires a certain amount of charge that can be accelerated with ultimate accelerants and this is the most powerful ability 
    a legend usually has that can make the most impact in a fight or situation.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players are dropped into a map at the start of the game with 2 other teamates, they have the decision of where they want to land and where to go next.
        The game usually starts off slow and players take this time to move from building to building looking for armor, guns, and attachments. As the game progresses
        the objective for players is to eliminate one another and be the last squad standing. The game has a circle which is random every game and players must be inside
        the circle's zone before the timer runs out or they will have to out run the zone that damages the player overtime eventually kiling them if they run out of health.
        There is also a ranked playlist where players gain RP based on the amount of kills/assist they can get a game and their placement. The RP they earn then can rank up
        players from Bronze 4 all the way up to the highest rank of Apex Predator.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong>Apex Legends</strong> is in my opinion the best battle royale type game out in the market currently. With the combination of fluid movement,
     fast paced gameplay, rewarding gunplay, and more each game can be a different experince for players being matched with different players everytime.
     With a consistent addition to new content from guns and legends to consistent balancing <strong>Apex Legends</strong> brings a competitive enviorment that 
     is both enjoyable to play and watch.<p>
